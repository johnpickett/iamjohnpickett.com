I'm a cloud and site reliability geek living in Salt Lake City, Utah. My thoughts may not always be earth-shattering but I enjoy documenting the process to refine my own understanding. My background includes Enterprise Architecture, Problem Management, Service Monitoring, Data Analysis &amp; Visualization, as well as a general comprehensive experience-based understanding of many IT operational methodologies.

When I'm not geeking out, I enjoy the fun things with my wife, dogs (Molly, Buddy, and Dexter), cats (Lily, Jay, and Felix), and chickens (Snowman, Fred, Hawk, Annie, Dollie, and Ceecee). Yes, we areÂ <em>those</em> kind of people.

When I want to feel inadequate, I'll occasionally try and develop my photography and video skills as well!
