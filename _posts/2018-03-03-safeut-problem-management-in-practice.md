There are few ways to become more intimately familiar with the day-to-day pains of your customers and help identify organizational process inefficiencies than walking in the shoes of a Problem Manager.

Roughly 18 months ago during my tenure as Problem Manager at the University of Utah, I created and began working Problem 40179 regarding real-time application notification issues reported by UNI Crisis Services. Several cross-functional teams (Network, Client Mgmt, Service Monitoring, ITSM, App Engineering) worked together to isolate root cause and put forward a recommendation to retire the 3rd party application in favor of one developed internally. Today, <a href="https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/safeut-help-is-just-a-text-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SafeUT has a mature strategy</a>, receiving interest and recognition from state and national leaders alike.

In the course of their duties, Problem Managers wear many hats. Perhaps the most important is that of institutional and customer/patient advocate; intent on delivering long-lasting positive change void of personal politics and gerrymandering.

Those involved with Problem Management processes often face an uphill battle of sorts. At times, you may feel like the only one in the organization who cares about the outcome of your case. Incident and Change processes typically receive a lot of attention due to their immediate impact to the operational state of the enterprise. Problems tend to be difficult to diagnose, require deep thought and analysis, and involve engaging teams that may not understand the importance of the work due to a limited perspective.

In a follow-up, I hope to share some strategies, skills, and techniques I've found useful while navigating Problem Management.
